# Bioethics, chemical safety and biosafety. 

Our [Genetics and Applied Genomics Laboratory](https://genomics.pucv.cl/) is committed to promoting and using the highest standards of bioethics, chemical safety and biosafety to conduct their scientific research. 

Bioethics helps us to work rigorously, in such a way that we can explain and argue to society and other researchers the benefits of doing research with people or animals. It also allows us to improve our protocols over time and will facilitate the analysis of why we have made a mistake in a certain action. Further, it is essential for our genetics research lab to promoting and using the highest standards of chemical safety and biosafety in order to protect the safety and health of our research staff, the public, and the environment. Chemical safety and biosafety protocols prevent the accidental release of hazardous materials, protect laboratory personnel from potentially hazardous materials, and ensure that the research itself is conducted in a safe and responsible manner. Additionally, proper chemical safety and biosafety protocols help to prevent the accidental or intentional misuse of research materials and protect the integrity of the research results. By adhering to the highest standards of chemical safety and biosafety, our genetics research lab will be able to ensure that its research is conducted with the utmost safety and accuracy, thus leading to more reliable results that can be used to benefit society.

In this repository you will find regulations, standards, protocols and certificates of bioethics, chemical safety and biosafety of the research we carry out in our laboratory.

Any questions, queries or suggestions please contact the researchers responsible for the projects we have carried out.
