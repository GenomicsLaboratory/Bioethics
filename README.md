# Bioethics

The Genetics and Applied Genomics Laboratory is committed to promoting and using the highest standards of bioethics to conduct their research. Bioethics helps us to work rigorously, in such a way that we can explain and argue to society and other researchers the benefits of doing research with people or animals. It also allows us to improve our protocols over time and will facilitate the analysis of why we have made a mistake in a certain action..

In this repository you will find regulations, standards, protocols and certificates of bioethics of the research we carry out in our laboratory.

Any questions, queries or suggestions please contact the researchers responsible for the projects we have carried out.
